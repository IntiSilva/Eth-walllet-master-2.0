This wallet uses Metamask to sign transactions, Ganache as the blockchain, an ERC20 token mock as currency,
Truffle as a compiler for the contracts, "config-override.js" is for applying the necesarry polyfills to the modules (have to do it manually since webpack 5),
Babel for tranlating react (because i'm not using JSX) and I think that's it, I made a token "USDT Mock" because I had
to change the decimals of the ERC20 token, just for the fun of it to see if it worked. Will work on
making the next version more automonomus.
